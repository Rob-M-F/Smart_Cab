# Smartcab simulator
This project simulates a smart cab in congested city streets and trains it using reinforcement learning to behave appropriately at intersections. The reinforcement learning algorithm models the state of the traffic signal and oncoming vehicle presence to the front and both sides.  

#### Prerequisites
* [Python 2.7](https://docs.python.org/2/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)  

### Quick Start
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:  
```python smartcab/agent.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent```  
The smartcab is represented by the white car.
